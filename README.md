Artificial Intelligence is a generalised term that covers many areas. Fundamentally it's about using computers (and machines) to peform various tasks in a way that in the pre-Articial Intelligence world relied on humans such as identifying patterns, decision making, other forms of problem solving, often using learning techniques to carry our these tasks. 

_Note: I'm not happy with the section names etc., but these have giving a starting point._
